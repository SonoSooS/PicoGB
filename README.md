# PicoGB

A small emulator libraray, which is capable to play Game Boy games, and a limited amount of Game Boy Color games.

PicoGB is designed to be easy to embed, and run as fast as possible, with the least amount of resource usage as possible.

## Embedding

See `pgb_main.h` for all the available functions to use.

The rest of the code has no dependencies, as it's the job of the embedder to implement callback functions not implemented in `fabric.c`.

## Source code layout

Core:
- `microcode.c` - actual CPU implementation, dispatches reads and writes (using a cache where possible)
- `mi.c` - Memory Interface, currently only contains cache invalidation functions
- `ppu.c` - Picture Processing Unit, contains all code regarding graphics, including scanline rendering, interrupts, and IO register handling
- `apu.c` - Audio Processing Unit, contains all code regarding sound rendering, including IO register processing
- `fabric.c` - IO register processing, and certain callback functions pre-implemented for Game Boy system

Extensions:
- `profi.c` - gcc call stack profiler, used to find and optimize away function calls where inlining makes sense
- `lru.c` - Last Recently Used cache, used to implement fast ROM bank cache on low-RAM systems (like the RP2040 port)
- `popcounter.h` - line drawing algorithm implemented using a shift register

Executable:
- `test.c` - Windows executable, sound doesn't work in wine (causes a hang (or rather it doesn't in Hungarian ðŸ¤“))
